To run this on your machine

1. Install dependencies with
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```

1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation (should start
   automatically though).
   You can change the port by using `npm start -- --port=8001`.
